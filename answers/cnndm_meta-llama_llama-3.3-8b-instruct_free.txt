Here are the summaries of each section:

1. A team of scientists has rediscovered the Jerdon's Babbler, a bird thought to be extinct for 73 years, in Myanmar. The bird was found using a recording of its distinctive call, and multiple birds were spotted nesting in a small area of grassland. The discovery has raised concerns about the bird's survival due to pressure on its habitat.

2. A Sydney pastor, Mal Feebrey, has spoken about the selfless act of Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan, who offered to donate his liver to save Feebrey's life when he was diagnosed with terminal liver disease. Chan's offer was a testament to their close friendship and shared Christian faith. Feebrey is now campaigning against Chan's execution, which is scheduled despite his appeals for clemency.

3. Everton boss Roberto Martinez has expressed concerns about the poor condition of the pitch at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium, where his team will play in the Europa League. Martinez believes the pitch will be equally problematic for both teams and has warned that it could affect the game.

4. The "health tourism gap" between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. The UK is now paying out £15 for every £1 it gets back, and the government has pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually.

5. North Carolina State University has disbanded a fraternity chapter after a notebook was found containing sexist and racially offensive entries. The university has also suspended all social events involving alcohol for 20 fraternities and will conduct a thorough review of the Greek system to assess whether fraternities and sororities are meeting core values and behavioral standards.
