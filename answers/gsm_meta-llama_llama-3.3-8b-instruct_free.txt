I'll solve each problem step by step and provide the answer.

**Problem 1:**
Erika wants to buy a laptop that costs $600. The price is reduced by $200 if she trades in her old laptop. She has some savings, was paid $150, and her mom gave her $80. She now needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. How much money does she have in her purse?

Let's break it down:

* Original price of the laptop: $600
* Price reduction: $200
* New price: $600 - $200 = $400
* Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she has: $400 - $50 = $350

She has $350, which is the sum of her savings, the money she was paid, and the money her mom gave her. Let's call her savings x. Then:

x + $150 + $80 = $350

Combine the constants:

x + $230 = $350

Subtract $230 from both sides:

x = $120

Erika has $120 in her purse.

**Answer:** $120

**Problem 2:**
The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, and the basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. How much more did the basketball coach spend than the baseball coach?

Let's calculate the total cost for each coach:

* Baseball coach: 9 baseballs × $3 = $27
* Basketball coach: 8 basketballs × $14 = $112

The difference is: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

**Answer:** $85

**Problem 3:**
Melanie wants to collect 200 toothpicks. She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks and wants to know how many more weeks it will take to collect 200 toothpicks.

Let's calculate the total toothpicks she has saved so far:

10 toothpicks/week × 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She still needs: 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, she will need:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

It will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

**Answer:** 8 weeks

**Problem 4:**
The employees of Google went on a day trip. 4 buses can hold 60 employees, 6 minibusses can hold 30 employees, and 10 minivans can hold 15 employees. How many employees can join the day trip?

Let's calculate the total capacity of each type of vehicle:

* Buses: 4 × 60 = 240 employees
* Minibusses: 6 × 30 = 180 employees
* Minivans: 10 × 15 = 150 employees

The total capacity is: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees

**Answer:** 570 employees

**Problem 5:**
A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?

Let's call the total number of jellyfish x. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, so:

x/15 = 6

Multiply both sides by 15:

x = 90

There are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

**Answer:** 90 jellyfish
