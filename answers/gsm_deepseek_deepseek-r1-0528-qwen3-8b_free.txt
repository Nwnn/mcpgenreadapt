### Problem 1
Erika needs $400 to buy the laptop after trading in her old one. She has $150 from her job and $80 from her mom, totaling $230. Since she only needs $50 more, she must have $350 in total. Therefore, the amount in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

**Answer:** 120

### Problem 3
Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. In 12 weeks, she has saved 10 × 12 = 120 toothpicks. She needs 200 toothpicks, so she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more. At 10 toothpicks per week, it will take 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

**Answer:** 8

### Problem 4
The buses hold 4 × 60 = 240 employees. The minibusses hold 6 × 30 = 180 employees. The minivans hold 10 × 15 = 150 employees. The total is 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

**Answer:** 570

### Problem 5
Let T be the total number of jellyfish. A fifth are large, so large jellyfish are (1/5)T. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so (1/3) × (1/5)T = (1/15)T change color. This equals 6, so T = 6 × 15 = 90. Verification: large jellyfish are 90 / 5 = 18, and (1/3) × 18 = 6 change color, which matches.

**Answer:** 90
