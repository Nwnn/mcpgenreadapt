Here are concise summaries of each section:

1.  A bird long thought extinct, the Jerdon's Babbler, was rediscovered in Myanmar's Bago region after scientists used its call recording. It was last seen in 1941. The small grassland habitat is threatened by development, and the rediscovered birds may constitute a new species.

2.  A death row inmate from the Bali Nine, Andrew Chan, offered his own liver for a transplant to save a close friend, Pastor Mal Feebrey, who suffers from terminal liver disease. Despite the appeal against Chan's execution being rejected, Feebrey praised Chan's selflessness and continues to campaign for clemency.

3.  Everton manager Roberto Martinez expressed concern about the poor condition of Dynamo Kiev's playing surface for their Europa League match. Both teams are affected equally, and while training was done off the field due to the cover, Martinez expects the poor pitch quality to impact both sides equally.

4.  The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is facing a significant funding gap, known as the 'health tourism gap', where it pays more than five times the amount it receives for treating British citizens abroad versus European visitors in the UK. The government aims to recover an extra Â£500 million annually by 2017/18 through stricter measures.

5.  North Carolina State University disbanded a fraternity chapter (Pi Kappa Phi) after a student found a notebook containing racist and sexist entries, including jokes about lynching and rape. Chancellor Randy Woodson stated this makes intolerance unacceptable and ordered a review of the university's Greek life. The fraternity may return with new members in 2018.
