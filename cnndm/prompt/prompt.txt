A bird that was long thought to have gone extinct has been rediscovered in Burma after a team of scientists used a recording of the species' distinctive call to track it down. The Jerdon's Babbler (chrysomma altirostre altirostre) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in Myanmar in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether. But a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in Myanmar's central Bago region in May last year, according to their report published in the latest edition of Birding Asia. Re-discovered: The Jerdon's Babbler which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in Burma . The scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along Myanmar's mighty Irrawaddy river, now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast Asian nation. At one small patch of grassland near an abandoned agricultural station, the team heard what they thought could be the babbler's call. They then used a recording of a Jerdon's Babbler from the Indian subcontinent to see if the bird would show itself. Frank Rheindt, from the National University of Singapore, told AFP he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey, which was also carried out with members of the Wildlife Conservation Society and Myanmar's Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division. 'It was unbelievable,' he recalled. 'We played the sound recordings and one of the birds came up from the reed beds. Like many song birds in reed beds you hardly ever see them, they only come out to defend their territory when they hear a territorial call.' Further searches over the next two days uncovered more birds allowing researchers to obtain blood samples and photographs. But researchers warned that the bird's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on Myanmar's few remaining grasslands. 'This discovery not only proves that the species still exists in Myanmar but that the habitat can still be found as well,' Colin Poole, director of Wildlife Conservation Society's regional hub in Singapore, said in a statement. 'Future work is needed to identify remaining pockets of natural grassland and develop systems for local communities to conserve and benefit from them,' he added. Birds fly over the Moe Yun Gyi Wetlands in Bago Division, Myanmar, where Jerdon's Babbler was re-discovered 73 years after it was believed to be extinct . Rheindt said the area of grassland where the bird was found was very small, 'around 50-80 hectares' and that new chicken and fish farms were being built nearby. He added that its plumage and song were significantly different to how it had been described by ornithologists in the early twentieth century - leading the team to suspect that it may differ from threatened populations found in Nepal, India and Pakistan. His team now hope to conduct DNA tests to decide if it is a separate species. Burma's quasi-civilian government replaced decades of brutal military rule in 2011. It has since embarked on a series of political reforms and shown itself to be far more open to foreign businesses and academic researchers than the country's generals were. Burma has more species of bird than any other country in mainland Southeast Asia, with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted.

A Sydney pastor has spoken about the incredible moment Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan offered a vital piece of himself in a bid to save the man's life. Mal Feebrey, a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when the death row inmate, with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant. Chan, who had been in jail for five years at the time, 'knocked' the Assemblies of God minister about when he heard of his friends plight and immediately said, 'have mine'. Scroll down for video . Mal Feebrey (above left), a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when Bali Nine kingpin Andrew Chan (above right), with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant . 'It really touched me. Here I am waiting for a donor, I'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going "my liver's ok, you can have mine",' Mr Feebrey told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'He was sort of like, if they want to kill me, then you can have my liver. It wasn't a passing-the-time comment, he wanted to make it happen. If he could have pulled it off he would have,' he said. Chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead, determined to save Mr Feebrey, who shared his Christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005. While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend. Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency. Mr Feebrey said that when Chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from Indonesian President Joko Widodo, he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail's clinic than himself. 'It was a bit surreal. Andrew took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy,' Mr Feebrey said .

The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians . Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency . Mr Feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with Chan, and is an outspoken advocate for the 'I Stand For Mercy Campaign'. The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians, and posted on his Instagram account after the Chan heard of his rejected Clemency appeal. 'Just spent the last half an hour with my friend Andrew Chan, when the Australian Consulate Staff notified him that his final appeal against [the] death sentence was rejected,' Mr Feebrey posted. 'He took it on the chin with courage, humility and with a contrite heart.' In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account. 'The most beautiful people that I've known are those that have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss and yet found a way out of these depths,' he posted underneath a photograph of himself with Chan. In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account . The men's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for Chan and Sukumaran, who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners, to be executed. 'Andrew is the idyllic, dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him – they want to put to death?,' Mr Feebrey asked. Both Chan and Sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside Kerobokan prison since 2009. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Earlier on Saturday the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo said that the pair could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison . Mr Praseyto said the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the poor condition of the pitch at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium is 'a concern' - but he is sure it will be just as problematic for one side as the other in Thursday's Europa League last-16 second-leg encounter. Rather than training on the pitch at their opponents' stadium as they normally would, Martinez' men did a session on the running track surrounding the playing surface - while the turf was covered by a protective sheet - following their arrival in Ukraine on Wednesday. And when asked about the state of the grass, the Spaniard said at his pre-match press conference: 'The pitch is a concern for both teams. Everton boss Roberto Martinez has expressed concerns over the quality of Dynamo Kiev's pitch . Everton players train ahead of their Europa League round of 16 second-leg with Dynamo Kiev . Everton currently lead the tie 2-1 on aggregate following their win at Goodison Park in the first-leg . With the pitch covered up, Everton players are made to train on the running track that surrounds it . Martinez has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both Everton and Dynamo Kiev . 'Dynamo Kiev are a technical team and they need a good pitch, and we are exactly the same. 'I don't think it will play a big part in terms of giving a favour or advantage to either of the two sides. 'I think it is a little bit of a shame for the game of football that the pitch is not going to be in perfect condition. 'But you have to adapt to whatever surface you play on.'

The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million (file picture) Hospitals’ failure to claw back the cost of treating Europeans is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week, figures suggest. The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. It means the UK is now paying out £15 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18. Both GPs and hospitals will be given incentives to identify non-British users of the NHS and payment procedures will be made easier. However, the latest Department of Health statistics indicate there is a long way to go. Released following a Freedom of Information request, they show that in 2013/14, British taxpayers handed £749.8million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens abroad. This has risen by £100million from £649.3million just a year before. But in the same period, the NHS managed to collect only £50.3million from European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here. This is an increase on the £32million total the year before – but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way. Ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment. Figures which emerged at the weekend show the NHS is still chasing at least £62million of unpaid bills for foreigners’ care. One London hospital trust alone – King’s College – is owed almost £18million from overseas patients. One single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than £420,000. Others owe more than £100,000 for treatments including dialysis, bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, according to The Sunday Times. Health minister Dan Poulter was even photographed with a new mother from Zimbabwe who is still being pursued for a £3,000 bill. Two years ago, cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned many foreigners were travelling to Britain for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’. Last night Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: ‘We’re fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world. ‘But we are not the International Health Service, it’s the National Health Service. This is an issue which needs to be addressed.’ Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said: ‘It is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for EU citizens.’ Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 . Part of the gap is due to the fact that so many British pensioners retire to the continent. There may also be more tourists from Britain travelling to mainland Europe than the other way round. But there are more than a million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other European countries. Under EU arrangements, UK citizens can be treated by other nations’ health services and the bill is sent back to Britain. In theory, these European nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the NHS. In 2013/14, the UK paid Ireland £246million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only £22million came back the other way. Some £250million was paid to Spain but only £3.2million came back. France received £152million but returned just £7million. Italy got £6.2million and sent back £1.1million, while Greece collected £8.9million and returned £400,000. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We want international visitors to feel welcome to use the NHS, provided they pay for it – just as families in the UK do through their taxes. ‘Our plans will help recoup up to £500million a year by 2017/18.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Emergency medical treatment is one thing, but taxpayers cannot be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer-term treatment for tourists. ‘Our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors.' Zimbabwean-born Caroline Nyadzyao, who is being chased for £3,000 by the NHS after giving birth in a Norfolk hospital, meets with health minister Daniel Poulter . Smiling alongside a health minister at a Norfolk maternity unit in 2013, this new mum is still being chased for the £3,000 it cost the NHS to help her give birth. Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo’s unpaid bill is part of the £62million cost of ‘health tourism’ to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. The mum said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told the Sunday Times it was ‘unfair ’ she was still being pursued, because the baby’s father is British. She said: ‘I know the system may believe I travelled to abuse the NHS benefits, but... I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that?’ The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013. However, they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it. Miss Nyadzayo said: ‘I was told because I was 31 weeks’ pregnant it was likely I was going to use the NHS to my advantage. We said we would pay for the birth. But we had no idea how much we’d be charged.’

North Carolina State University disbanded a fraternity chapter Wednesday following the discovery of a notebook filled with sexist and racially offensive entries in a restaurant off campus. The punishment comes amid recent cases of bad behavior at the University of Oklahoma, Penn State and other schools put fraternities in the national spotlight. University Chancellor Randy Woodson announced that the Tau Chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity was disbanded, effective immediately. The fraternity was ordered to immediately vacate its on-campus house. North Carolina State University disbanded Pi Kappa Phi after a book containing sickening jokes about rape and lynching was found by a female student at a restaurant near the school's campus in Raleigh . The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like: 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching' Besides the lynching line, the book contained the phrase: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' Woodson said 'I hope today's action makes it clear that there is no place for intolerance, sexism and racism at N.C. State. 'I know the poor behaviors we've seen recently by a few in no way represent the strong character and values of our larger student body. 'N.C. State will work hard to ensure these outlying actions never become accepted or tolerated at our university.' Woodson's announcement comes one week after the notebook containing sexist and racist remarks attributed to Pi Kappa Phi fraternity members was found at a restaurant near campus. The book and its contents were then featured by a local television station. A different N.C. State fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega, was suspended earlier this month after details of drug paraphernalia seized from its house surfaced in a search warrant related to a sexual assault allegation. N.C. State responded by temporarily suspending all social events involving alcohol for more than 20 fraternities on campus. Frat said: 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant . Woodson also called Wednesday for a 'thorough review' of the university's Greek system. The review will assess whether fraternities and sororities are meeting the core values and high behavioral standards of the university, and will focus on a range of issues including sexual misconduct, substance abuse, and diversity and inclusion. Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018. 'We appreciate the support and collaboration with the N.C. State administration,' said Mark E. Timmes, the chief executive of Pi Kappa Phi. 'Together, we acted quickly to address this situation and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.' Pi Kappa Phi had earlier suspended its chapter at N.C. State until the investigation concerning the green book found at a restaurant near the school's Raleigh campus was completed. The contents of the Pi Kappa Phi notebook were first broadcast by television station WRAL. The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like 'If she's hot enough, she doesn't need a pulse.' and 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching.' It also contained the comments: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' and 'I like little girls.' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant. She said: 'The contents were horrible. 'I wanted to make sure everybody knew this was going on so it could be corrected. 'Frats are looked up to, but this is what they are doing. Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018 . Alpha Tau Omega's NC State chapter was suspended earlier this month amid allegations of sexual assault . 'I hope other fraternities are disgusted. 'I hope that if they do have this sort of thing going on in theirs, that they'll realize, whether they want to or not, that they should change, that they shouldn't promote this kind of behavior.' Pi Kappa Phi chief executive officer Mark Timmes earlier called the quotes 'reprehensible and unacceptable'. He said: 'We have sent staff to Raleigh to investigate the circumstances of the situation. 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated. 'We are working closely with the university and have instructed our students to cooperate fully with all investigation efforts. 'We appreciate the university's collaboration in quickly addressing the situation.' N.C. State's alcohol ban doesn't apply to historically black Greek organizations or the Multicultural Greek Council. In announcing the alcohol crackdown, N.C. State said the school also plans training on diversity for chapters and other measures to increase accountability. In the Alpha Tau Omega investigation, a woman called police March 1 to say she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house. She also told officers drugs - including cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills - were being sold out of the house. Campus police Sgt. J.P. Dye seized drug paraphernalia, a scale and white powder in a small bag during a search of the empty house. Wynn Smiley, Alpha Tau Omega's national chief executive officer, said the fraternity had kicked out a pledge who had white powder and other drug paraphernalia in his room. The student had been associated with the organization for less than a month, Smiley said. He said the national organization conducted its own investigation with a lawyer and other alumni advisers, and the organization believes the woman was exaggerating about drugs being sold and the level of drug activity. He also questioned her credibility on the sexual assault allegation. Smiley said: 'It just didn't line up with what we were finding out.' Kayle Graham, a junior psychology major at NC State, said racism and sexism among students is sad because the younger generation's attitude indicates where the country is heading. She said: 'It's unfortunate that at a college level, students aren't as mature and socially aware as one would like them to be.'
